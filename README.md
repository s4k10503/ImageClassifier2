# Image Classifier 2

## Overview

Image Classifier 2 is a app that performs image classification using pre-trained ONNX models.  
For now, the app is intended to work locally, but with future expansion in mind, it uses Flutter for the front-end and Python for the back-end.  
The previous [Image Classifier](https://github.com/s4k10503/ImageClassifier) used only Python.  

## Features

* [×] Thumbnail Display: Displays the selected image as a thumbnail.
* [×] Inference: Performs inference on the selected image and displays the predicted label and confidence percentage.
